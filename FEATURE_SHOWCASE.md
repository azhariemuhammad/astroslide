# 🌙 Mineral Moon Feature Showcase

## What You Can Do Now

### 🎨 Four Powerful Enhancement Presets

Your AstroSlide installation now includes four specialized enhancement algorithms:

---

## 🌙 Mineral Moon
**The Star of the Show**

### What It Does
Reveals the hidden colors of the Moon's surface by dramatically amplifying mineral signatures.

### The Science
The Moon's surface contains:
- **Titanium** (creates blue tones in maria)
- **Iron** (creates orange/brown in highlands)
- **Other minerals** (create yellow intermediate zones)

These colors exist but are invisible to the naked eye. Mineral Moon makes them pop!

### Visual Effect
- **Before**: Gray/white moon with subtle shading
- **After**: Vibrant blue seas, orange highlands, yellow transition zones

### Best Results With
- Full moon images
- High-resolution telescope photos
- Stacked images from smart telescopes
- Well-focused lunar surface shots

### Example Use Case
```
Input: Seestar S50 stacked moon image (gray, flat)
Preset: Mineral Moon
Output: Stunning colorful moon showing geological features
Share: Instagram, astronomy forums, print for wall art
```

## 🌌 Deep Sky Boost
**For Nebulae and Galaxies**

### What It Does
Brings out faint nebula colors and sharpens stars while reducing noise.

### Algorithm Highlights
- Histogram stretch optimized for deep space
- 40% saturation boost for nebula colors
- Unsharp mask for star sharpening
- Moderate noise reduction

### Best Results With
- Orion Nebula
- Andromeda Galaxy
- Lagoon Nebula
- Star clusters
- Any deep space object

### Visual Effect
- Enhanced nebula colors (reds, blues, greens)
- Sharper, more defined stars
- Better contrast between object and background
- Reduced noise from long exposures

## 🪐 Planet Sharp
**For Planetary Detail**

### What It Does
Maximizes surface detail and reduces atmospheric blur.

### Algorithm Highlights
- Strong sharpening for planetary features
- Mild histogram stretch (preserves atmosphere)
- Aggressive noise reduction
- Minimal color changes (realistic)

### Best Results With
- Jupiter (Great Red Spot, cloud bands)
- Saturn (rings, Cassini Division)
- Mars (polar caps, surface features)
- Detailed lunar craters
- Venus (cloud patterns)

### Visual Effect
- Crisp planetary details
- Enhanced surface features
- Reduced atmospheric blur
- Natural-looking colors

---

## ✨ General Auto
**The Safe Default**

### What It Does
Balanced enhancement suitable for any astrophotography subject.

### Algorithm Highlights
- Moderate histogram stretch
- Gentle 15% saturation boost
- Light noise reduction
- Preserves natural look

### Best Results With
- Mixed field images
- Wide-field Milky Way
- Unknown subjects
- When you're not sure which preset to use
- As a starting point

### Visual Effect
- Natural enhancement
- Improved contrast
