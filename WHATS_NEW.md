# What's New: Professional Mineral Moon Enhancement 🌙

## TL;DR

The Mineral Moon feature has been **completely redesigned** based on professional astrophotography workflows. The default is now **much more realistic** (60% saturation instead of 350%), and you get **three variants** to choose from!

## The Problem

The original Mineral Moon was **too saturated** - using a 3.5x (350%) saturation boost that made lunar images look fake and oversaturated.

## The Solution

We researched how professional astrophotographers actually process lunar images in Photoshop and Lightroom, then implemented those techniques. Now you get:

### 🌙 Mineral Moon (Professional) - NEW DEFAULT ⭐

**Realistic mineral colors using professional workflow**

- Saturation: 1.6x (60% increase) - much more moderate!
- Uses LAB color space for better color control
- Smooth gamma curves instead of harsh histogram stretch
- Matches professional Photoshop/Lightroom results
- **Recommended for most users**

### 🌕 Mineral Moon (Dramatic)

**Very strong color enhancement for artistic effect**

- Saturation: 3.5x (350% increase) - the old algorithm
- Maximum "wow factor"
- Great for social media and artistic images
- Use when you want extreme colors

### 🌔 Mineral Moon (Subtle)

**Conservative enhancement for scientific accuracy**

- Saturation: 1.25x (25% increase) - very conservative
- Most realistic appearance
- Good for scientific documentation
- Closest to telescope views

## What This Means for You

### If you liked the old Mineral Moon:
✅ It's still available! Use **Mineral Moon (Dramatic)**

### If you thought the old one was too much:
✅ Try the new **Mineral Moon (Professional)** - much more realistic!

### If you want even more subtle:
✅ Use **Mineral Moon (Subtle)** for scientific accuracy

## How to Use

1. Upload your lunar image
2. You'll now see **three Mineral Moon options**
3. Select the one that fits your needs:
   - **Professional** → Realistic but enhanced (recommended)
   - **Dramatic** → Maximum color impact
   - **Subtle** → Scientific accuracy
4. Click Enhance and compare results!

## Technical Improvements

### Professional Workflow
The new default uses the same techniques as professional astrophotographers:

1. **Auto white balance** - Neutral starting point
2. **Smooth curves** - Gamma correction (not harsh histogram stretch)
3. **LAB color space** - Better control of mineral colors
   - A channel (red/orange) ×1.6
   - B channel (blue/yellow) ×1.5
4. **Moderate saturation** - HSV ×1.6 (60% increase)
5. **Unsharp mask** - Detail enhancement
6. **Light denoising** - Preserve lunar texture

### Research-Based
Based on techniques from:
- Professional Photoshop lunar processing tutorials
- Lightroom preset collections for astronomy
- NASA imaging workflows
- Amateur astronomy community best practices

## Comparison

| Feature | Old Mineral Moon | New Professional | Dramatic | Subtle |
|---------|------------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| Saturation | 3.5x (350%) | 1.6x (60%) | 3.5x (350%) | 1.25x (25%) |
| Realism | Low | High | Low | Very High |
| Color Space | HSV only | LAB + HSV | HSV only | LAB + HSV |
| Processing | Harsh stretch | Smooth curves | Harsh stretch | Gentle curves |
| Best For | N/A | Most users | Artistic | Scientific |

## Why This Matters

**More realistic colors** that actually match what professional astrophotographers create, while still revealing the Moon's beautiful mineral composition:

- **Blue maria** = Titanium-rich volcanic plains
- **Orange highlands** = Iron-rich ancient crust
- **Yellow regions** = Mixed mineral compositions

All three variants show **real mineral signatures** - just at different enhancement levels!
